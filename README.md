Three component model for the rheology of soft glassy materials

## Abstract
 
We test the validity of the Three Component model [1], describing the flow behavior of soft glassy materials, on carbomer microgel yield stress materials. To highlight the importance of the viscous contribution from the solvent, we formulate the carbomer yield stress materials using propylene glycol as continuous phase in place of water.We demonstrate that the contribution of the solvent viscosity captured by the background viscosity term in the TC model is relevant and follow the solvent’s Arrhenius dependence as a function of temperature.

## Outline

* Microgel based yield stress fluids are often used as model system for soft glassy materials and yield stress fluids.
* We test the validity of the Three Component model [1], describing the flow behavior of soft glassy materials, on microgel yield stress materials. 
* To test the importance of the viscous contribution from the solvent, we formulate the carbomer yield stress materials using propylene glycol as continuous phase in place of water. 
* We demonstrate that the contribution of the solvent viscosity captured by the background viscosity term in the TC model is relevant and follow the solvent’s Arrhenius dependence as a function of temperature.
* Aknowledging the viscous contribution is important on several fronts. It solves a trivial, yet problematic, inconsistency of current approches which often imply a vanishing terminal viscosity at high shear. Enable quntitativly better fit of the data, especially at high shear. Solves inconsistencies in building mastercurves.
* We demonstrated that when choosing the model to describe the rheology for soft glassy materials, even in the case of microgel based system, it is important to select a model that includes a non zero teminal viscosity such as the three component model.

## What frontiers in physics says about articles rules 

Original Research articles are peer-reviewed, have a maximum word count of 12,000 and may contain no more than 15 Figures/Tables. Authors are required to pay a fee (A-type article) to publish an Original Research article. Original Research articles should have the following format: 1) Abstract, 2) Introduction, 3) Materials and Methods, 4) Results, 5) Discussion. 

### Figures guidelines

Figures should be prepared with the PDF layout in mind. Individual figures should not be longer than one page and with a width that corresponds to 1 column (85 mm) or 2 columns (180 mm).

All images must have a resolution of 300 dpi at final size. Check the resolution of your figure by enlarging it to 150%. If the image appears blurry, jagged or has a stair-stepped effect, the resolution is too low.

    The text should be legible and of high quality. The smallest visible text should be no less than 8 points in height when viewed at actual size.
    Solid lines should not be broken up. Any lines in the graphic should be no smaller than 2 points wide.

Please note that saving a figure directly as an image file (JPEG, TIF) can greatly affect the resolution of your image. To avoid this, one option is to export the file as PDF, then convert into TIFF or EPS using a graphics software.
