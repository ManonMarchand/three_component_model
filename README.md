Three component model for the rheology of soft glassy materials
 
We test the validity of the Three Component model [1], describing the flow behavior of soft glassy materials, on carbomer microgel yield stress materials. To highlight the importance of the viscous contribution from the solvent, we formulate the carbomer yield stress materials using propylene glycol as continuous phase in place of water.We demonstrate that the contribution of the solvent viscosity captured by the background viscosity term in the TC model is relevant and follow the solvent’s Arrhenius dependence as a function of temperature.

* Aknowledging the viscous contribution is important on several fronts. It solves a trivial, yet problematic, inconsistency of current approches which often imply a vanishing terminal viscosity at high shear. Enable quntitativly better fit of the data, especially at high shear. Solves inconsistencies in building mastercurves.
* We demonstrated that when choosing the model to describe the rheology for soft glassy materials, even in the case of microgel based system, it is important to select a model that includes a non zero teminal viscosity such as the three component model.
